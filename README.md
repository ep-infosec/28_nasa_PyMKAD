# PyMKAD

The world-wide aviation system is one of the most complex dynamical systems ever developed and is generating data at an extremely rapid rate. Most modern commercial aircraft record several hundred flight parameters including information from the guidance, navigation, and control systems, the avionics and propulsion systems, and the pilot inputs into the aircraft. These parameters may be continuous measurements or binary/categorical measurements recorded in one second intervals for the duration of the flight. Currently, most approaches to aviation safety are reactive, meaning that they are designed to react to an aviation safety incident or accident. PyMKAD is a novel approach based on the theory of multiple kernel learning to detect potential safety anomalies in very large data bases of discrete and continuous data from world-wide operations of commercial fleets. This code address an anomaly detection problem which includes both discrete and continuous data streams, where we assume that the discrete streams influence on the continuous streams. We also assume that atypical sequence of events in the discrete streams can lead to off-nominal system performance.  

The objective of this project is to automate the analysis of flight safety incidents in a way that combines both analysis of discrete and continuous parameters.
